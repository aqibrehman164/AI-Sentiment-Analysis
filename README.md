# Twitter Sentiment Analysis of AI Topics in Databricks Cloud

## Overview

This project was run in Databricks using Spark to analyze recent news about "AI" for sentiment evaluation. The goal of this project is to practice traditional NLP techniques like:
- Tokenization
- Stopword Removal
- Count Vectorization (CV) and TF-IDF
- N-grams

Additionally, the project applied tools like **AWS S3**, **Athena**, and **QuickSight** to process and visualize big data effectively.

---

## Features
- **Integration with Databricks Cloud**: Seamlessly connects with Databricks for scalable data processing.
- **NLP Pipeline**: Implements traditional NLP techniques for text analysis.
- **Big Data Processing**: Utilizes AWS services (S3, Athena, QuickSight) for handling and visualizing large datasets.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Includes insightful visualizations of the analysis results.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Databricks account with access to a workspace.
- AWS credentials with permission to access S3 buckets.
- Python environment with the required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`).

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis.git
   cd Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
   ```

2. Set up your Databricks workspace:
   - Upload the notebook to Databricks.
   - Configure the AWS credentials in the notebook.

3. Mount the S3 bucket:
   Use the provided script to mount your S3 bucket:
   ```python
   def mount_s3_bucket(access_key, secret_key, bucket_name, mount_folder):
       # Code provided in the Jupyter Notebook
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Databricks.
2. Run the data preprocessing cells to clean and tokenize Twitter data.
3. Train the sentiment analysis model.
4. Visualize results and export insights.
